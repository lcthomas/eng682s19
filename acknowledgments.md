# Acknowledgments
I am indebted to many people for contributions to this syllabus. Those whose syllabi I have taken readings, assignments, and ideas from include Ryan Cordell, Ben Schmidt, Miriam Posner, Andrew Goldstone, and Alan Liu. I have also drawn on the syllabus for the introduction to DH course I co-taught with Allison Schifani in Spring 2017.
